{"name":"Ccv-cuda-tracking","tagline":"GPU implementation using Nvidia CUDA framework.","body":"I am submitting my proposal on GPU implementation in CCV. In the latest release of CCV, GPU support was removed, hence I found it as a good opportunity to contribute to the community this summer. I will be using Nvidia CUDA to achieve this goal. The deliverables I will be providing as initial implementation this summer will be GPU filtering and GPU blob finding. I will be leaving the task of blob tracking to CPU because porting of knn algorithm on GPU might adversely affect CCV performance.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/cudacv)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2011 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2011](http://db.tt/JHJQ8Itn)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Remaldeep Singh\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Mathieu Virbel","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
